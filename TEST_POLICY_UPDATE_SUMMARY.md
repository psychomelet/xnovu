# Test Policy Update Summary

## Overview
Updated all test files to comply with the strict test policy defined in CLAUDE.md:
- NEVER skip tests due to missing credentials
- ALWAYS fail explicitly when requirements aren't met
- Tests either pass completely or fail explicitly

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed `hasRealCredentials` Pattern
- Eliminated all instances of `hasRealCredentials` variable
- Replaced with direct credential validation in tests that require them
- Credentials are now validated at the point of use, not stored in a variable

### 2. Service Connection Tests (`__tests__/services/`)
#### NovuConnection.test.ts
- Removed `hasRealCredentials` check
- Added direct validation in `beforeEach` that throws on invalid credentials

#### SupabaseConnection.test.ts
- Removed `hasRealCredentials` check
- Converted all warning logs to explicit errors
- Removed cases where tests would pass despite errors
- Added proper error messages for all failure scenarios

### 3. Unit Tests
#### TemplateRenderer.test.ts
- Removed `hasRealCredentials` check
- Converted skipped tests to tests that throw on missing credentials
- Tests that don't require real credentials use provided values or defaults

### 4. Integration Tests (`__tests__/integration/`)
#### SubscriptionManager.integration.test.ts
- Removed `hasRealCredentials` check
- Added separate validation for Supabase and Novu credentials in `beforeEach`

#### RuleEngineService.integration.test.ts
- Removed `hasRealCredentials` check
- Converted skipped tests to tests that throw on missing credentials

#### RuleEngine.integration.test.ts
- Removed `SKIP_INTEGRATION_TESTS` pattern
- Converted all conditional test execution (`it.skip`) to regular tests
- Added validation in `beforeAll` that throws when Redis is not available

## Key Principles Applied

1. **No Silent Failures**: Tests no longer skip or pass when credentials are missing
2. **Clear Error Messages**: All credential failures include specific instructions
3. **Fail Fast**: Credential validation happens early (in `beforeEach`/`beforeAll`)
4. **No Conditional Execution**: Removed all `condition ? it.skip : it` patterns
5. **Explicit Failures**: All error conditions now throw with descriptive messages

## Benefits

1. **CI/CD Reliability**: Tests will fail immediately if environment is misconfigured
2. **Developer Clarity**: Clear error messages guide proper setup
3. **No False Positives**: Tests can't pass by skipping critical validations
4. **Consistent Behavior**: All tests follow the same strict validation pattern
