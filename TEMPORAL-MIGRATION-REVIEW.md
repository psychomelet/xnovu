# Temporal Migration Review

## Overview
Successfully completed full migration from BullMQ/Redis to Temporal workflows. The system now relies purely on Temporal for all asynchronous processing.

## What Was Removed

### Dependencies
- ✅ **bullmq** - Removed from package.json
- ✅ **ioredis** - Removed from package.json
- ✅ **Redis** - No longer required

### Code Removed
- ✅ `/app/services/queue/` - Entire queue service directory
- ✅ `/worker/` - Worker architecture directory
- ✅ `/cli/commands/worker.ts` - Worker CLI commands
- ✅ `/app/services/RuleEngineService.ts` - Legacy service
- ✅ `/app/services/scheduler/` - Scheduler services
- ✅ `/lib/temporal/shadow-mode.ts` - Shadow mode implementation

### Files Updated
- ✅ `package.json` - Removed BullMQ/Redis deps, added Temporal deps
- ✅ `EnhancedSubscriptionManager.ts` - Uses Temporal workflows
- ✅ `DaemonManager.ts` - Orchestrates Temporal workflows
- ✅ `daemon/index.ts` - Removed Redis config
- ✅ `daemon/types/daemon.ts` - Removed Redis/queue types
- ✅ Test setup scripts - Updated for Temporal
- ✅ Docker compose files - Removed Redis/worker services
- ✅ Documentation - Updated to reflect Temporal

## Current Architecture

### Temporal Workflows
1. **Master Orchestration Workflow** (`orchestrationWorkflow`)
   - Manages lifecycle of all subsystems
   - Coordinates cron and scheduled workflows
   
2. **Notification Processing Workflow** (`notificationProcessingWorkflow`)
   - Processes individual notifications
   - Handles INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE events
   
3. **Cron Scheduling Workflow** (`cronSchedulingWorkflow`)
   - Executes cron-based rules
   - Managed by orchestration workflow
   
4. **Scheduled Notification Workflow** (`scheduledNotificationWorkflow`)
   - Processes time-based notifications
   - Polls for due notifications

### Key Components
- **TemporalService** - Manages Temporal worker within daemon
- **TemporalClient** - Singleton client for workflow execution
- **Activities** - Reusable business logic (Supabase queries, Novu triggers)

### Configuration
All Temporal configuration via environment variables:
- `TEMPORAL_ADDRESS` - Temporal server address
- `TEMPORAL_NAMESPACE` - Namespace (default: "default")
- `TEMPORAL_TASK_QUEUE` - Task queue name
- `TEMPORAL_MAX_CONCURRENT_ACTIVITIES` - Activity concurrency
- `TEMPORAL_MAX_CONCURRENT_WORKFLOWS` - Workflow concurrency

## Verification Checklist

### Code Verification
- [x] No imports of 'bullmq' or 'ioredis'
- [x] No references to Redis URLs or connections
- [x] No queue-related types or interfaces
- [x] All async processing uses Temporal workflows
- [x] Worker functionality integrated into daemon

### Infrastructure Verification
- [x] Docker compose files updated
- [x] No Redis containers defined
- [x] No worker containers defined
- [x] Temporal configured as external service

### Documentation Verification
- [x] README.md updated with Temporal info
- [x] DAEMON-README.md reflects new architecture
- [x] Migration guide created
- [x] Environment examples updated

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Simplified Infrastructure** - No Redis to manage
2. **Better Reliability** - Temporal's durable execution
3. **Improved Visibility** - Temporal UI for monitoring
4. **Easier Scaling** - Horizontal scaling via Temporal
5. **Reduced Complexity** - Single orchestration model

## Migration Complete ✅

The system now purely relies on Temporal for all workflow orchestration and asynchronous processing. No legacy BullMQ or Redis code remains.
