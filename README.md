# XNovu - Smart Building Notification Platform

A comprehensive notification system built with Next.js and Novu, featuring Temporal workflows for reliable and scalable notification processing in smart building management platforms.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js** - React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Novu** - Open-source notification infrastructure
- **Supabase** - Database and real-time subscriptions
- **Temporal** - Durable workflow execution platform
- **React Email** - Build emails with React components
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **pnpm** - Fast, disk space efficient package manager

- [Architecture Overview](docs/architecture.md) - Complete system design and components
- [API Reference](docs/api-reference.md) - REST API endpoints
- [Operations Guide](docs/operations-guide.md) - Deployment and monitoring
- [Novu Workflows](docs/novu-workflow.md) - Workflow development guide

## âš¡ Temporal-Powered Architecture

The system uses Temporal workflows for:

- **Durable Execution** - Workflows survive failures and restarts
- **Automatic Retries** - Built-in retry policies with exponential backoff
- **Scalable Processing** - Horizontal scaling with worker pools
- **Workflow Visibility** - Real-time monitoring and debugging
- **Time-based Scheduling** - Cron and scheduled notifications

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm (install with `npm install -g pnpm`)
- Docker & Docker Compose (for Temporal)
- Novu account and API keys
- Supabase project with notification schema

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

## Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start Temporal services
pnpm temporal:start
```

## Development

```bash
# Start Next.js dev server (port 4000)
pnpm dev

# In another terminal, start Novu dev server
pnpm dlx novu@latest dev

# View Temporal UI
pnpm temporal:ui
```

All three services must be running for full functionality.

## ðŸš€ Simplified Workflow Sync

Deploy your workflows with a single command:

```bash
# Development: Automatically creates tunnel and syncs
pnpm xnovu sync

# Production: Uses NOVU_BRIDGE_URL from environment
pnpm xnovu sync --production
```

This single command handles:
- Finding an available port automatically (avoids conflicts)
- Starting the Next.js server (dev mode)
- Creating a public tunnel via LocalTunnel (dev mode)
- Syncing workflows to Novu Cloud
- Updating workflow metadata in database
- Cleaning up resources when done (unless --keep-alive is used)

See [docs/workflow-sync.md](docs/workflow-sync.md) for detailed documentation.

## Available Scripts

```bash
pnpm dev              # Start development server
pnpm build            # Build for production
pnpm start            # Start production server
pnpm lint             # Run ESLint
pnpm test             # Run unit tests
pnpm test:integration # Run integration tests
pnpm xnovu            # CLI commands for utilities

# Workflow sync (NEW: simplified single-command deployment)
pnpm xnovu sync              # Auto-starts server on random port, creates tunnel, syncs
pnpm xnovu sync --keep-alive # Keep tunnel running after sync (for testing)
pnpm xnovu sync --production # Production sync with existing bridge URL

# Temporal commands
pnpm temporal:start   # Start Temporal services
pnpm temporal:stop    # Stop Temporal services
pnpm temporal:logs    # View Temporal logs
pnpm temporal:ui      # Open Temporal UI (http://localhost:8080)
```

## API Endpoints

### Core Notification APIs
- `POST /api/novu` - Novu bridge for workflow sync
- `POST /api/trigger` - Trigger workflows
- `GET /api/dev-studio-status` - Check Novu connection

## Temporal Workflows

### Notification Processing Workflow
Processes individual notifications with retry logic and error handling.

### Realtime Monitoring Workflow
Polls Supabase for new notifications when realtime subscriptions are not available.

### Scheduling Workflows
- **Cron Scheduling** - Execute notifications based on cron expressions
- **Scheduled Notifications** - Process time-based notifications

### Master Orchestration Workflow
Coordinates all subsystems and manages workflow lifecycles.

## Worker Operation

The worker runs all notification services:

```bash
# Start the worker
pnpm xnovu worker:start

# Check worker status
pnpm xnovu worker:status

# Stop the worker
pnpm xnovu worker:stop
```

## Monitoring

### Temporal UI
Access the Temporal Web UI at http://localhost:8080 to:
- View running workflows
- Inspect execution history
- Debug failures
- Monitor performance

### Health Endpoints
- Worker health: http://localhost:3001/health
- Detailed status: http://localhost:3001/status
